# Part of Speech (POS) Tagging

In this assignment I will implement a Hidden Markov Model for Part of Speech tagging. <br />

The objectives of this assignment are:
* Better understanding of POS
* Better understanding of HMM and generative sequence models

<br />

Extracted tokens and POS tags are taken from [the English Web Treebank via the Universal Dependencies Project](http://universaldependencies.org/).
